          <h2>WHAT IS A FUEL INJECTOR ?</h2><br> 
          <p>Fuel injector spray fuel into a carâ€™s engine using valves, capable of opening
           and closing many times a second. They have an atomising nozzle that distributes the petrol or diesel evenly, 
           for optimum combustion and efficiency. Injectors were introduced as a replacement for the old carburettor
            system, since they help engines run with greater fuel efficiency and also help to reduce emissions. A car
             generally has one fuel injector per cylinder. So, if you drive a four-cylinder car, it will most likely 
             have four fuel injectors.</p>

          <h2>HOW DOES A FUEL INJECTOR WORK ?</h2><br>
          <p>
            Fuel injectors control the volume of fuel delivered to the combustion chamber, ensuring the right amount is injected 
            at the right time. <br><br> The process is:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Fuel pump pushes petrol or diesel through the fuel lines to the injectors.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  ECU (engine control unit) uses sensors to work out the right time to fire the injectors and spray fuel into the combustion chamber. 
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  When the ECU activates the injector, pressurised fuel is sprayed into the combustion chamber through the nozzles.
                  Because the nozzles are so small, the fuel is atomised, which makes it burn more efficiently.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p><br><br>
          <h3>Mechanism (Mechanical Fuel Injector) :</h3><br>
          <p>The primary mechanism used here to inject fuel is rather similar to the carburetor systems used in the past, its why a lot of people still get it 
            confused with carburetted engines but actually, there is quite an important difference between these two. While the carburetted system fetches low-pressure 
            fuel from the fuel tank, these mechanical fuel injector 
            systems pump a high-pressure fuel from the fuel tank, which is the basic principle of how the mechanical fuel injectors work.</p><br>
            <p>Once pumped from the fuel tank, the fuel then enters the accumulator. You can think of an accumulator as a buffer for the temporary storage of the fuel. Then comes in play
               the metering control unit of the system. Its job is to distribute the fuel to the 
              cylinders. Here, the delivery of the right amount of fuel into cylinders in the right amount of time is of the essence.</p><br>
              <p>While entering inside the cylinder, the fuel and air must be mixed very precisely, with the right amount of both. This is achieved by using the flap valve, 
                which is located inside the air intake of the engine. It lets the fuel come in the correct flow to be mixed with the air in the right amount. Whenever we increase or decrease the speed of the vehicle, 
                the flap valve opens more or less, respectively, the same is the case with the fuel distributor. Hence, both stay in proportion.</p><br>
                <p>Here, two springs are used for the system to work. One is the mainspring and the other one is called 
                  Plunger spring. The mainspring has the job to control the fuel inlet to the fuel injector, the fuel coming from the fuel pump is pressurized, 
                  and this pressure causes the mainspring to open and let the fuel inside the fuel injector.</p><br>
                  <p>As the fuel enters the inlet, it mixes with the air, and the pressure increases, this increasing pressure causes the plunger
                     spring to move to and fro which in turn makes the plunger move outward causing the nozzle to open, and hence the controlled
                      spray of the fuel occurs. As you can notice, the mechanism used here is dependent upon
                     springs, which is the reason why mechanical injectors are often referred to as spring-loaded injectors by many technicians.</p><br>
                     <p>Once the fuel injection is complete for a given cycle, according to the input given by the control unit, the pressure then decreases and eventually
                        the plunger which was being pushed outward stops experiencing the pressure and comes to its initial position.
                        This results in seizure of the spray and hence the fuel pumping is stopped for that certain cycle.</p>
